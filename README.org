* How do I use it?
  - edit the configuration in the pyuio.py file or
    export an PYUIO_SETTINGS environment variable
    pointing to a configuration file.

  - install the app from the root of the project directory

    pip install -r requirements.txt

  - initialize the database with this command:
    cd WebSite/
    python pyuio.py db init
    python pyuio.py db migrate
    python pyuio.py db upgrade

  - now you can run WebSite:

    python pyuio.py runserver

    the application will greet you on

    http://localhost:5000/
